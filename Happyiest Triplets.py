#Problem :- Three arrays of the same size are given. Find a triplet such that (maximum â€“ minimum) in that triplet is the minimum of all the triplets. 
#           A triplet should be selected in a way such that it should have one number from each of the three given arrays. This triplet is the happiest 
#           among all the possible triplets. Print the triplet in decreasing order. If there are 2 or more smallest difference triplets, then the one with 
#           the smallest sum of its elements should be displayed.

    Input:
        N=3
        a[] = { 5, 2, 8 }
        b[] = { 10, 7, 12 }
        c[] = { 9, 14, 6 }  
    Output: 7 6 5
    
    Explanation:
        The triplet { 5,7,6 }  has difference
        (maximum - minimum)= (7-5) =2 which is
        minimum of all triplets.
