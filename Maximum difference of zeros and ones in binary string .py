#Problem :- Given a binary string of 0s and 1s. The task is to find the maximum difference of 
#           the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s â€“ number of 1s) in the substrings of a string.
#           Note: In the case of all 1s, the answer will be -1.

#Example :
"""
    Input : S = "11000010001" 
    Output : 6 
    Explanatio: From index 2 to index 9, 
    there are 7 0s and 1 1s, so number 
    of 0s - number of 1s is 6.
