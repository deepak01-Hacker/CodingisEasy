#Problem : Given an array with N distinct elements, convert the given array to a reduced 
#          form where all elements are in range from 0 to N-1. The order of elements is same, 
#          i.e., 0 is placed in place of smallest element, 1 is placed for second smallest element,
#           â€¦ N-1 is placed for largest element.

#Explanation :- 
"""
Input:
    N = 3   
    Arr[] = {10, 40, 20}

    Output: 0 2 1

    Explanation: 10 is the least element so it
    is replaced by 0. 40 is the largest
    element so it is replaced by 3-1 = 2. And
    20 is the 2nd smallest element so it is
    replaced by 1.
